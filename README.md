# Word Recolor

# What

To colorize words that I want

Because vs code does not support custom words coloring

Here I have recolored 'NULL' 'FALSE' 'TRUE' to different distinguishable colors

# How to
1. Run the command `Word Recolor : activate`

# How it works
1. It will generate default.json file in a path
2. The path can be shown thru the command `Word Recolor : show path`
3. By editting that path, you can make extension to recolor any words to any colors you want
4. After editting it, run command `Word Recolor : clear` -> `Word Recolor : Activate` to make it take effect
